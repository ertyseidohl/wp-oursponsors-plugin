OurSponsors displays links to sponsors/partners on your site, with customizable levels of sponsorship

== Description ==

A plugin for keeping track of sponsors at various levels. Allows users to create sponsors and sponsor levels, manage their display, and use shortcodes for customizing which sponsors are displayed.

Allows users to keep sponsors for past years which are no longer sponsors but may become sponsors in the future, or who want to be displayed as past sponsors.

Works with or without bootstrap to display columns. No dependencies.

== Installation ==

Install this plugin via the wordpress plugin installation.
Activate this plugin, which will add three default sponsors and two default levels. Feel free to delete or edit these sponsors.
Use the following shortcodes to display sponsors:

[oursponsors all="all"] display all sponsors (all years)
[oursponsors year="2017"] display just sponsors for 2017

Note that you either have to say "all" or one year. Multiple years will probably arrive in a later update.

Customize the display of the sponsors according to your site in oursponsors-user.css or via the wordpress custom css editor.
